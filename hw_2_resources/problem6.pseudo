# Design a method for keeping two stacks within a single linear array
# s[SPACESIZE] so that neither stack overflows until all of memory is used and an
# entire stack is never shifted to a different location within the array. Write
# methods push1, push2, pop1, and pop2 to manipulate the two stacks. (Hint:
# the two stacks grow toward each other.)
