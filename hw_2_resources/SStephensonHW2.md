# Problems
## Problem Problem 1a
Pseudo-code implementation.  In this, `i` is the element to insert at base of stack and `s` is the input stack:
\small
```
\read_block{problem1a.pseudo}
```
\normalsize
\newpage
## Problem 1b
Pseudo-code implementation.  In this, `i` is the element to insert in the third position of the stack and `s` is the input stack:
```
\read_block{problem1b.pseudo}
```
\newpage
## Problem 2a
The below table represents each character as it's being iterated over, what the stack looks like, and any stack operation that is being applied:

\small
|Character|Stack|Stack Operation|
|---------+-----+---------------|
|{        |{    |Push '{'       |
|[        |[{   |Push '['       |
|A        |[{   |None           |
|+        |[{   |None           |
|B        |[{   |None           |
|]        |{    |Pop '['        |
|-        |{    |None           |
|[        |[{   |Push '['       |
|(        |([{  |Push '('       |
|C        |([{  |None           |
|-        |([{  |None           |
|D        |([{  |None           |
|)        |[{   |Pop '('        |
|]        |{    |Pop '['        |
|END      |{    |Check empty    |
\normalsize
After iterating through all characters, stack is non-empty so delimiters are not properly matching.

## Problem 2b
The below table represents each character as it's being iterated over, what the stack looks like, and any stack operation that is being applied:

\small
|Character|Stack|Stack Operation|
|---------+-----+---------------|
|(        |(    |Push '('       |
|(        |((   |Push '('       |
|H        |((   |None           |
|)        |(    |Pop '('        |
|\*        |(    |None           |
|{        |{(   |Push '{'       |
|(        |({(  |None           |
|[        |[({( |Push '['       |
|J        |[({( |None           |
|+        |[({( |None           |
|K        |[({( |None           |
|]        |({(  |Pop '['        |
|)        |{(   |Pop '('        |
|}        |(    |Pop '{'        |
|)        |     |Pop '('        |
|END      |     |Check empty    |
\normalsize

After iterating through all characters, stack is empty so delimiters are properly matching.

## Problem 3
Pseudo-code implementation checking mirrored strings:
\small
```
\read_block{problem3.pseudo}
```
\normalsize
A Python implementation of the above algorithm with some test cases is as follows.  As these problems start to require more modular code, it becomes easier for me to just write the code in Python than writing consistent pseudo-code:
\small
```python
\read_block{problem3.py}
```
\normalsize
\newpage
## Problem 4

The below code is a slight modification and extension of the above code.  For this implementation, we use two stacks.  One stack collects everything inbetween the 'D's (the 'D-segments') and the second stack is used within the function to test if the extracted D-segment sequence stack represents a valid xCy mirrored string.  Again, test strings are asserted at the end.
\small
```python
\read_block{problem4.py}
```
\normalsize
\newpage
## Problem 5
For this, I'll be using the same Stack class defined above and simply extending it with a method for inserting an element in the stack and reading an element within the stack.  For this example, we'll implement it so that the elements are indexed from oldest (bottom of stack) as 0 to newest (top of stack) as stack length.
\small
```python
\read_block{problem5.py}
```
\normalsize
